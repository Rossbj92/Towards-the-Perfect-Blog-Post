# Towards the Perfect Data Science Blog Post

Scraping nearly 10,000 blog posts from the the [Towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/) archives, I attempted to build a machine learning model to predict the claps that a post received. 

## Replication Instructions

1. Clone repo
2. Run [webscraper](Notebooks/Scraping.ipynb) notebook
3. Process data with [cleaning](Notebooks/Cleaning.ipynb) notebook
4. Model ([modeling](Notebooks/Modeling.ipynb) notebook)

## Directory Descriptions

```Data```
- ```medium_2020_posts.pkl``` - raw scraped data used in the cleaning notebook
- ```medium_2020_processed.pkl``` - cleaned data used in the modeling notebook

```Notebooks```
- [Scraping](Notebooks/Scraping.ipynb) - used for scraping the Towardsdatascience archives
- [Cleaning](Notebooks/Cleaning.ipynb) - text processing, feature engineering, EDA
- [Modeling](Notebooks/Modeling.ipynb) - model building and evaluation

```Fonts```
- Custom fonts used in notebooks for plotting

```Presentation```
- pdf and ppt format of final project presentation

## Conclusions

- Break posts into sections
- Use visuals
- Avoid passive voice
- Tutorials and overviews garner more interest than news pieces (e.g., trends in tech)

Future directions will focus on new data sources, such as author characteristics (e.g., followers) and social media factors (e.g., tweets of post). 

### Methods Used
- Linear modeling (linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- Poisson regression
- Random forest
- Topic modeling
- Cross validation
